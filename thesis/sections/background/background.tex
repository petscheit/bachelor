% good idea for introducing gas as power/efficiency metric

% When discussing scaling, gas is a good metric to look at. Every block in Ethereums blockchain has a gas limit that can't be oversteped, \todo{check this, miners should be able to seal blocks still i think} so its a good indicator of proccessing power of the network. At the same time, transactions with smart-contracts use an amount of gas for there execution. The amount of gas needed is defined by the opcodes used for that transaction, which have a fixed price. In that sense, a smart-contracts efficiency can be defined by the amount of gas needed for a transaction. 

% As with all computer systems, scaling can be achived by increasing processing power. Increasing the processing power of a distributed system however, is a complex process. Given that the system is optimized, the only real approach to increasing processing power is sharding. Conceptually, sharding can be seen as upgrading to a multi-core CPU. We seperate the network into individual shards, not requiring every node to proccess every transaction, thereby increasing the processing power of the entire network. Transitioning to a sharded network, namely Eth2, is a highly complex process expected to take years to complete. While this is an inevitable step, aimed at increasing the networks processing power, it wont help in scaling the network for the next couple of years. Shorter term solutions are needed. 

% Another approach for scaling is increasing a smart-contracts efficiency. As in traditional software applications, reducing the computational cost per operation will in general increase our throughput. In smart-contracts this can be achived by reducing the amount of gas needed for a executing a transaction. As every block has a maximum amount of gas that can be proccessed, reducing it will result in an increased amount of transactions to be proccessed in that block. In smart-contracts data-storage is very expensive. To reduce cost

\subsection{zk-rollup}
% Zk-rollup \cite{vbuterin_2018} is a layer-2 scaling approach first introduced to mass validate transfer of assets on the Ethereum blockchain in 2018. A user can deposit funds into a smart contract by providing a merkle path to its balance and adding funds to be deposited to the transaction. The smart-contract checks if its root can be recreated with the provided merkle path, updates the balance according to the funds in the transaction, rehashes the entire tree and updates its root to the resulting hash. An event is then emitted, containing the new balance, putting the data on-chain is a cheap way. The merkle tree, which is required for generating the merkle paths, containing the balances can be kept in sync by listing to these events. 

% To make a transfer, a user sends the receivers address, tranfer amount and its signature to the relayer as an http request. Once enough transfer requests have been received, the relayer checks if this transfer is covered by a users balance and if the signature is valid, and updates the balance of involved users accordingly. All of this is done in a zkSNARK program, which will return a proof object, the new balances and the new merkle root. These are then sent to the smart-contract. If the zkSNARK proof can be verified, we have proven that the new balances and the root are correct. We now emit the new balances as an event, thereby moving custody of transfered funds to the receiving users, who are now able to transfer or withdraw them. Withdrawing of funds follows the same logic as depositing, however instead of sending funds, a parameter is added containing the requested amount.
